## These commands have also been appending a "changes.json"... which can be
##  used to later automatically generate a commit comment.
##  This may literally be a git commit message, but the snapshotting/commit
##   may use some other format than git as well (and may or may not need such a message).

bond commit
## Recognizes what the storage form is (probably git, atm) and commits a snapshot.
## Returns the ware ID of the new snapshot.
## May run a series of "pre-commit" "hooks" first!
##  These may generate advisories and interactive prompts.
##  Common checks include "does not modify an existing catalog|release|selector hash", etc.

## Pulls in records from another factbase.
## Checks that they're all coherently mergable with ours, appending freely.
## Changes are all staged; commit may be required as usual (the other repo's
##  history is not dragged along -- and indeed, remember, since "it's not necessarily git",
##  there might not *be* "history" like that).

# TODO examples of releasing something, together with all the formulas and runrecords that made it.
# a.k.a. the actual interesting/hard part
