### It's unfortunate that by putting names in the list here... (why is that a list?)...
###  We've got the problem mdm had again, don't we?
###  Our *UI itself* needs a defacto way to sort these.  And people can't be trusted to make their things sort like semver strings (obviously)...
###  ... and people can't be trusted not to want to *change their minds* about those strings.
### The crux is this: if you want to look up whether something is a hazard, and someone changed that name, you shouldn't fail.  But you will.
### I don't actually know if there's a solution to this given some of the core n-to-1's smattered around, unless we just get all denial-y about them.
